### Creating new features

Once data in brought in for analysis, we can begin thinking about the interesting/relevant features that go into the analysis.  Our goal is primarily exploratory: we want to tell a story based on the data.  In that sense, any piece of information contained in the data can be useful.  Additionally, new information (or features) can be extracted from existing data points.  It is not only important to think of which features to extract, but also what their column type must be, so that later analyses run appropriately.  As a first example, consider a simple transformation for extracting the percentage that passengers tipped for the trip.

This is where we encounter the `rxDataStep` function, a function that we will revisit many times. `rxDataStep` is an essential function in that it is the most important data transformation function in `RevoScaleR` (the others being `rxMerge` and `rxSort`); most other analytics functions are data summary and modeling functions.  `rxDataStep` can be used to

- modify existing columns or add new columns to the data
- keep or drop certain columns from the data before writing to a new file
- keep or drop certain rows of the data before writing to a new file

In a local compute context, when we run `rxDataStep`, we specify an `inData` argument which can point to a `data.frame` or a CSV or XDF file.  We also have an `outFile` argument that points to the file we are outputting to, and if both `inData` and `outFile` point to the same file, we must set `overwrite = TRUE`.  **Note that `outFile` is an optional argument: leaving it out will output the result into a `data.frame`.  However, in most cases that is not what we want, so we need to specify `outFile`.**


```{r 3.01}
rxDataStep(nyc_xdf, nyc_xdf, 
           transforms = list(tip_percent = as.integer(tip_amount*100 / (tip_amount + fare_amount))),
           overwrite = TRUE)
rxSummary( ~ tip_percent, nyc_xdf)
```

In the last part `rxDataStep` was introduced to perform a simple one-liner transformation.  We now use `rxDataStep` again to perform some other, this time more complicated transformations.  We can sometimes perform these more complex transformations as longer one-liners using the `transforms` argument, following the above example.  But a cleaner way to do it is to create a function that contains the logic of our transformations and pass it to the `transformFunc` argument. This function takes the data as input and usually returns the same data as output with one or more columns added or modified. More specifically, the input to the transformation function is a `list` whose elements are the columns.  Otherwise, it is just like any R function. Using the `transformFunc` argument allows us to focus on writing a transformation function and quickly testing them on the sample `data.frame` before we run them on the whole data.

For the NYC Taxi data, we are interested in comparing trips based on day of week and the time of day.  Those two columns do not exist yet, but we can extract them from pickup datetime and dropoff datetime.  To extact the above features, we use the `lubridate` package, which has useful functions for dealing with date and time columns.  To perform these transformations, we use a transformation function called `f_datetime_transformations`.


```{r 3.02}
f_datetime_transformations <- function(data) { # transformation function for extracting some date and time features
  
  weekday_labels <- c('Sun', 'Mon', 'Tue', 'Wed', 'Thu', 'Fri', 'Sat')
  cut_levels <- c(1, 5, 9, 12, 16, 18, 22)
  hour_labels <- c('1AM-5AM', '5AM-9AM', '9AM-12PM', '12PM-4PM', '4PM-6PM', '6PM-10PM', '10PM-1AM')
  
  pickup_datetime <- ymd_hms(data$tpep_pickup_datetime, tz = "UTC")
  pickup_hour <- addNA(cut(hour(pickup_datetime), cut_levels))
  pickup_dow <- factor(wday(pickup_datetime), levels = 1:7, labels = weekday_labels)
  levels(pickup_hour) <- hour_labels
  
  dropoff_datetime <- ymd_hms(data$tpep_dropoff_datetime, tz = "UTC")
  dropoff_hour <- addNA(cut(hour(dropoff_datetime), cut_levels))
  dropoff_dow <- factor(wday(dropoff_datetime), levels = 1:7, labels = weekday_labels)
  levels(dropoff_hour) <- hour_labels
  
  data$pickup_hour <- pickup_hour
  data$pickup_dow <- pickup_dow
  data$dropoff_hour <- dropoff_hour
  data$dropoff_dow <- dropoff_dow
  data$trip_duration <- as.integer(as.duration(dropoff_datetime - pickup_datetime))
  
  data
}
```

Before we apply the transformation to the data, it's ususally a good idea to test it and make sure it's working.  We set aside a sample of the data as a `data.frame` for this purpose. Running the transformation function on `nyc_sample_df` should return the original data with the new columns.


```{r 3.03}
library(lubridate)
Sys.setenv(TZ = "US/Eastern") # not important for this dataset
head(f_datetime_transformations(nyc_sample_df)) # test the function on a data.frame
```




We run one last test before applying the transformation.  Recall that `rxDataStep` works with a `data.frame` input too, and that leaving the `outFile` argument means we return a `data.frame`.  So we can perform the above test with `rxDataStep` by passing transformation function to `transformFunc` and specifying the required packages in `transformPackages`.


```{r 3.04}
head(rxDataStep(nyc_sample_df, transformFunc = f_datetime_transformations, transformPackages = "lubridate"))
```

Everything seems to be working well.  This does not guarantee that running the transformation function on the whole dataset will succeed, but it makes it less likely to fail for the wrong reasons.  If the transformation works on the sample `data.frame`, as it does above, but fails when we run it on the whole dataset, then it is usually because of something in the dataset that causes it to fail (such as missing values) that was not present in the sample data.  We now run the transformation on the whole data set.


```{r 3.05}
st <- Sys.time()
rxDataStep(nyc_xdf, nyc_xdf, overwrite = TRUE, transformFunc = f_datetime_transformations, transformPackages = "lubridate")
Sys.time() - st
```

Let's examine the new columns we created to make sure the transformation more or less worked.  We use the `rxSummary` function to get some statistical summaries of the data.  The `rxSummary` function is akin to the `summary` function in base R (aside from the fact that `summary` only works on a `data.frame`) in two ways:

- It provides numerical summaries for numeric columns (except for percentiles, for which we use the `rxQuantile` function).
- It provides counts for each level of the factor columns.

We use the same *formula notatation* used by many other R modeling or plotting functions to specify which columns we want summaries for.  For example, here we want to see summaries for `pickup_hour` and `pickup_dow` (both factors) and `trip_duration` (numeric, in seconds).


```{r 3.06}
rxs1 <- rxSummary( ~ pickup_hour + pickup_dow + trip_duration, nyc_xdf)
# we can add a column for proportions next to the counts
rxs1$categorical <- lapply(rxs1$categorical, function(x) cbind(x, prop = round(prop.table(x$Counts), 2)))
rxs1
```

Separating two variables by a colon (`pickup_dow:pickup_hour`) instead of a plus sign (`pickup_dow + pickup_hour`) allows us to get summaries for each combination of the levels of the two factor columns, instead of individual ones.


```{r 3.07}
rxs2 <- rxSummary( ~ pickup_dow:pickup_hour, nyc_xdf)
rxs2 <- tidyr::spread(rxs2$categorical[[1]], key = 'pickup_hour', value = 'Counts')
row.names(rxs2) <- rxs2[ , 1]
rxs2 <- as.matrix(rxs2[ , -1])
print(rxs2)
```


In the above case, the individual counts are not as helpful to us as proportions from those counts, and for comparing across different days of the week, we want the proportions to be based on totals for each column, not the entire table.  We ask for proportions based on column totals by passing the 2 to as second argument to the `prop.table` function. We can also visually display the proportions using the `levelplot` function.


```{r 3.08}
levelplot(prop.table(rxs2, 2), cuts = 4, xlab = "", ylab = "", main = "Distribution of taxis by day of week")
```

Interesting results manifest themselves in the above plot:

1. Early morning (between 5AM and 9AM) taxi rides are predictably at their lowest on weekends, and somewhat on Mondays (the Monday blues effect?).
2. During the business hours (between 9AM and 6PM), about the same proportion of taxi trips take place (about 42 to 45 percent) for each day of the week, including weekends.  In other words, regardless of what day of the week it is, a little less than half of all trips take place beween 9AM and 6PM.
3. We can see a spike in taxi rides between 6PM and 10PM on Thursday and Friday evenings, and a spike between 10PM and 1AM on Friday and especially Saturday evenings. Taxi trips between 1AM and 5AM spike up on Saturdays (the Friday late-night outings) and even more so on Sundays (the Saturday late-night outings).  They fall sharply on other days, but right slightly on Fridays (in anticipation!). In other words, more people go out on Thursdays but don't stay out late, even more people go out on Fridays and stay even later, but Saturday is the day most people choose for a really late outing.

### Adding neighborhoods

We now add another set of features to the data: pickup and dropoff neighborhoods.  Getting neighborhood information from longitude and latitude is not something we can hardcode easily, so instead we rely a few GIS packages and a **shapefile** (coutesy of Zillow [http://www.zillow.com/howto/api/neighborhood-boundaries.htm]).  A shapefile is a file that contains geographical information inside of it, including information about boundaries separating geographical areas.  The `ZillowNeighborhoods-NY.shp` file has information about NYC neighborhoods.  After reading in the shapefile and setting the coordinates of the NYC taxi data, we can use the function `over` (part of the `sp` package) to find out pickup and dropoff neighborhoods.  We will not cover the specifics of working with shapefiles, and refer the user to the `maptools` package for documentation.


```{r 3.09}
library(rgeos)
library(sp)
library(maptools)
library(stringr)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)

nyc_shapefile <- readShapePoly('ZillowNeighborhoods-NY/ZillowNeighborhoods-NY.shp')
mht_shapefile <- subset(nyc_shapefile, str_detect(CITY, 'New York City-Manhattan'))

mht_shapefile@data$id <- as.character(mht_shapefile@data$NAME)
mht.points <- fortify(gBuffer(mht_shapefile, byid = TRUE, width = 0), region = "NAME")
mht.df <- inner_join(mht.points, mht_shapefile@data, by = "id")

library(dplyr)
mht.cent <- mht.df %>%
  group_by(id) %>%
  summarize(long = median(long), lat = median(lat))

library(ggrepel)
ggplot(mht.df, aes(long, lat, fill = id)) + 
  geom_polygon() +
  geom_path(color = "white") +
  coord_equal() +
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  geom_text_repel(aes(label = id), data = mht.cent, size = 3)
```


![png](./images/output_36_0.png)



```{r 3.10}
find_nhoods <- function(data) {
  # data <- as.data.frame(data)
  
  pickup_longitude <- ifelse(is.na(data$pickup_longitude), 0, data$pickup_longitude)
  pickup_latitude <- ifelse(is.na(data$pickup_latitude), 0, data$pickup_latitude)
  dropoff_longitude <- ifelse(is.na(data$dropoff_longitude), 0, data$dropoff_longitude)
  dropoff_latitude <- ifelse(is.na(data$dropoff_latitude), 0, data$dropoff_latitude)
  
  data_coords <- data.frame(long = pickup_longitude, lat = pickup_latitude)
  coordinates(data_coords) <- c('long', 'lat')
  nhoods <- over(data_coords, shapefile)
  data$pickup_nhood <- nhoods$NAME
  data$pickup_borough <- nhoods$CITY
  
  data_coords <- data.frame(long = dropoff_longitude, lat = dropoff_latitude)
  coordinates(data_coords) <- c('long', 'lat')
  nhoods <- over(data_coords, shapefile)
  data$dropoff_nhood <- nhoods$NAME
  data$dropoff_borough <- nhoods$CITY
  
  data
}
```

Once again, it is a good idea to try the transformation function on the sample `data.frame` to catch any errors before deploying it to the whole data. Sometimes errors messages we get are more informative when we apply the transformation to a `data.frame`, and it's easier to trace it back and debug it.  So here we use `rxDataStep` and feed it `nyc_sample_df` (with no `outFile` argument) to see what the data looks like after applying the transformation function `find_nhoods` to it.


```{r 3.11}
# test the function on a data.frame using rxDataStep
head(rxDataStep(nyc_sample_df, transformFunc = find_nhoods, transformPackages = c("sp", "maptools"), 
                transformObjects = list(shapefile = nyc_shapefile)))
```

#### ELDERSVELD - see if we can avoid this as it takes too long...
#### JFENNESSY -- maybe a good place to take a break afters tarting the execution?
Since everything went well, we can now apply the transformation to the whole data and reasonably expect that it should work.


```{r 3.12}
st <- Sys.time()
rxDataStep(nyc_xdf, nyc_xdf, overwrite = TRUE, transformFunc = find_nhoods, transformPackages = c("sp", "maptools", "rgeos"), 
           transformObjects = list(shapefile = nyc_shapefile))

Sys.time() - st
head(nyc_xdf)
```

By passing `~ .` as the formula to `rxSummary`, we can summarize all the columns in the data.


```{r 3.13}
system.time(
rxs_all <- rxSummary( ~ ., nyc_xdf)
)
```


```{r 3.14}
nhoods_by_borough <- rxCrossTabs( ~ pickup_nhood:pickup_borough, nyc_xdf)
nhoods_by_borough <- nhoods_by_borough$counts[[1]]
nhoods_by_borough <- as.data.frame(nhoods_by_borough)

# get the neighborhoods by borough
lnbs <- lapply(names(nhoods_by_borough), function(vv) subset(nhoods_by_borough, nhoods_by_borough[ , vv] > 0, select = vv, drop = FALSE))
print(lnbs)
```


Since the lion's share of taxi trips take place in Manhattan, we focus our attention to Manhattan only and ignore the other four boroughs.  For that purpose, we create two new columns called `pickup_nb` and `dropoff_nb` based on the original columns `pickup_nhood` and `dropoff_nhood` except that their factor levels are limited to Manhattan neighborhoods (any other factor level will be replaced with an NA).  It is important to do so, because otherwise neighborhoods outside of Manhattan will show up in any modeling or summary function involving those columns.


```{r 3.15}
manhattan_nhoods <- rownames(nhoods_by_borough)[nhoods_by_borough$`New York City-Manhattan` > 0]

refactor_columns <- function(dataList) {
  dataList$pickup_nb = factor(dataList$pickup_nhood, levels = nhoods_levels)
  dataList$dropoff_nb = factor(dataList$dropoff_nhood, levels = nhoods_levels)
  dataList
}

rxDataStep(nyc_xdf, nyc_xdf, 
           transformFunc = refactor_columns,
           transformObjects = list(nhoods_levels = manhattan_nhoods),
           overwrite = TRUE)

rxSummary( ~ pickup_nb, nyc_xdf)
```
